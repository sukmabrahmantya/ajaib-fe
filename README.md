## Notes

- I implement multiple searches, where the user can search by any key. The key limits are username, name (including title, first, and last name), and email.
- I've only fetched the API list once before, the filter or lookup used is the data it has accommodated. I didn't apply any filter or search from the API, because the data will keep changing randomly.
